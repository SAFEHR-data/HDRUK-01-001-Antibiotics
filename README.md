-   Ensure that you have access to the database and necessary credentials to connect.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Download the Repository**\
    Download this repository:

    -   Either download as a ZIP file using `Code -> Download ZIP`, then unzip.
    -   Or, use GitHub Desktop to clone the repository.

2.  **Open the R Project**

    -   Navigate to the `Study` folder and open the project file `Study.Rproj` in RStudio.
    -   You should see the project name in the top-right corner of your RStudio session.

3.  **Run the Analysis Code**

    -   Open the `CodeToRun.R` file. This is the main script youâ€™ll use.
    -   Follow the instructions within the file to add your database-specific information.
    -   Run the code as directed. This will generate a `Results` folder containing the outputs, including a ZIP file with the results for sharing.

4.  **OPTIONAL: Visualize Results in Shiny**

    -   Navigate to the `Report` folder, then the `DED_shiny` folder, and open the project file `DrugExposureDiagnosticsShiny.Rproj` in RStudio.
    -   You should see the project name in the top-right corner of your RStudio session.
    -   Copy the generated result file (in .zip format) into the `data` folder located within the `DED_shiny` folder.
